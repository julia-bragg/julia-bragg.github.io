            <p> Microsoft Word for Marketers: A Time-Saving Guide is a comprehensive software documentation manual designed for marketing professionals and students.

This project strengthened my ability to describe complex software functions into clear, actionable steps, demonstrating skills in technical communication, content structuring, and user-focused documentation. I also learned the process of user research by interviewing Subject Matter Experts(SME’s) and usability testing by conducting usability tests. This guide highlights my growth in problem-solving, instructional design, and creating an accessible resource that enhances productivity for a target audience. </p>
