<li>Optional toppings: Chopped Nuts (peanuts, pistachios, pecans, etc.), Toasted coconut, Sprinkles, Mini chocolate chips (any flavor),Graham cracker crumbs, Crushed Oreo cookies, Melted white chocolate, Crushed candy canes </li>

</ul>


<h2> How do you do it? </h2>

<ol> 

    <li> First, wash your strawberries! Make sure to dry them very well or else your chocolate will not stick properly. </li>
    <li> If you're using toppings, add a handful of your choice on a plate.   </li>
    <li> Line a sheet pan with wax or parchment paper for your strawberries.  </li>
    <li> Microwave your melting chocolate in a small bowl, removing and stirring every 30 seconds to ensure you won't burn the chocolate. Continue until chocolate is melted and smooth!</li>
    <li> Taking your washed and dried strawberry by the stem, dip into the melted chocolate. Lift and hover the strawberry to allow the excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl. This ensures an even coating of chocolate for each strawberry! Dip your strawberry into your desired toppings, then place onto your pan. Repeat with the rest of the strawberries.</li>
    <li> Finally, enjoy your delicious chocolate covered strawberries!</li>
