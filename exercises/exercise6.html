        <h1> Get to know me! </h1> 
        <h2> A little about me... </h2>
        <p> I'm studying English and Information Technology at UMass Amherst, with a certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communication. I’m passionate about technology, software, and innovation, and I enjoy making complex ideas easier to understand through writing.
        <h2> More about me...</h2>
        <p> I have experience writing Op/Eds for the Massachusetts Daily Collegian, tutoring at the UMass Writing Center, and serving as Head Editor of Jabberwocky’s fiction team, a student-run literary magazine. Currently, I'm a technical writing intern at the  <a href="https://ds.cs.umass.edu">Center for Data Science and Artifical Intelligence</a>. </p>
