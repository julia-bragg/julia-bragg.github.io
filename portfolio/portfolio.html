        <h2>Microsoft Word Manual: <i>Microsoft Word for Marketers: A Time-Saving Guide</i></h2>
        <p> Microsoft Word for Marketers: A Time-Saving Guide is a modular software documentation manual designed for marketing professionals and students. As my first long-term technical writing project, this guide breaks down essential Microsoft Word 2024 for Mac features, focusing on efficiency, organization, and document design. This project strengthened my ability to describe software functions into clear, actionable steps, demonstrating skills in technical communication, content structuring, and user-focused documentation. I also learned the process of user research by interviewing Subject Matter Experts and usability by conducting usability tests. This guide highlights my growth in problem-solving, instructional design, and creating an accessible resource that enhances productivity for a target audience.  </p>

        <h2>Grant Proposal</h2>
        <p> This is a grant proposal to the Malala Fund advocating for an 8-week literacy and leadership program for South Sudanese women. This project involved deep research into grant writing, fundraising materials, and statistical analysis, while also integrating three forms of Artificial Intelligence to support content development. Through this work, I gained skills in persuasive writing, financial research, and strategic planning for securing funding and driving real social impact.
