        <h2>Microsoft Word Manual: <i>Microsoft Word for Marketers: A Time-Saving Guide</i></h2>
        <p> Microsoft Word for Marketers: A Time-Saving Guide is a modular software documentation manual designed for marketing professionals and students. This guide breaks down essential Microsoft Word 2024 for Mac features, focusing on efficiency, organization, and document design. This project strengthened my ability to describe software functions into clear, actionable steps, demonstrating skills in technical communication, content structuring, and user-focused documentation. I learned the process of user research by interviewing Subject Matter Experts and usability by conducting usability tests. This guide highlights my growth in problem-solving, instructional design, and creating an accessible resource that enhances productivity for a target audience.  </p>

        <h2>Internship Documentation: FAQ and Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
        <p> As a Technical Writing Intern at the Center for Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, I created a technical support resource to support Unity documentation. I identified recurring user-focused issues, outlined common questions, and separated content into an FAQ and a troubleshooting guide. These user-focused resources improved support for Unity—a collaborative, multi-institutional computing platform accelerating large-scale research at the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center. </p>
